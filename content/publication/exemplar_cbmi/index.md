abstract: Ensembles of Exemplar-SVMs have been used for a wide variety of tasks, such as object detection, segmentation, label transfer and mid-level feature learning. In order to make this technique effective though a large collection of classifiers is needed, which often makes the evaluation phase prohibitive. To overcome this issue we exploit the joint distribution of exemplar classifier scores to build a taxonomy capable of indexing each Exemplar-SVM and enabling a fast evaluation of the whole ensemble. We experiment with the Pascal 2007 benchmark on the task of object detection and on a simple segmentation task, in order to verify the robustness of our indexing data structure with reference to the standard Ensemble. We also introduce a rejection strategy to discard not relevant image patches for a more efficient access to the data.
