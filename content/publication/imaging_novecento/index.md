abstract: Imaging Novecento is a native mobile application that can be used to get insights on artworks in the “Museo Novecento” in Florence, IT. The App provides smart paradigms of interaction to ease the learning of the Italian art history of the 20 century. Imaging Novecento exploits automatic approaches and gamification techniques with recreational and educational purposes. Its main goal is to reduce the cognitive effort of users versus the complexity and the numerosity of artworks present in the museum. To achieve this the App provides automatic artwork recognition. It also uses gaming, in terms of a playful user interface which features state-of-the-art algorithms for artistic style transfer. Automated processes are exploited as a mean to attract visitors, approaching them to even lesser known aspects of the history of art.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: A mobile app for the "Museo Novecento" in Florence, Italy, for recognizing paintings and transfer their style to personal photos.
