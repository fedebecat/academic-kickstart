abstract: NeuronUnityIntgration2. 0 (demo video is avilable at http://tiny. cc/u1lz6y) is a plugin for Unity which provides gesture recognition functionalities through the Perception Neuron motion capture suit. The system offers a recording mode, which guides the user through the collection of a dataset of gestures, and a recognition mode, capable of detecting the recorded actions in real time. Gestures are recognized by training Support Vector Machines directly within our plugin. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our application through an experimental evaluation on a newly collected dataset. Furthermore, external applications can exploit NeuronUnityIntgration2. 0's recognition capabilities thanks to a set of exposed API.
