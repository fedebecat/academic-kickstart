abstract: One of the most complex aspects of autonomous driving concerns understanding the surrounding environment. In particular, the interest falls on detecting which agents are populating it and how they are moving. The capacity to predict how these may act in the near future would allow an autonomous vehicle to safely plan its trajectory, minimizing the risks for itself and others. In this work we propose an automatic trajectory annotation method exploiting an Iterative Plane Registration algorithm based on homographies and semantic segmentations. The output of our technique is a set of holistic trajectories (past-present-future) paired with a single image context, useful to train a predictive model.
